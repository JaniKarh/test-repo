*Did it work?*

This is written on iPad Pro 2018 with a mechanical keyboard attached. Backlight on the keyboard works. Cannot switch Cmd + Option from Windows layout to Mac-layout :(

This feels radically odd to use, btw. Then again, the writing feels quite good witha proper keyboard.

This works even on another try. **This thing is loud!**

If I was to write longform text in serious manner, this propably would be the way to go.

Hello from iPadOS 13.1!
